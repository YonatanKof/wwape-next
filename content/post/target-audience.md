> *Alice:* Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?  
> *The Cheshire Cat:* That depends a good deal on where you want to get to.  
> *Alice:* I don't much care where.  
> *The Cheshire Cat*: Then it doesn't much matter which way you go.

> *The Cheshire Cat:* Oh, you're sure to do that, if only you walk long enough.

## Premiss

If you aim to get somewhere, and do it by NOT walking long enough – having a target is crucial and Target Audience can really help. 

## Why Target Audience?

Image a conference for doctors – What would you try to sell there? An app for managing patients **or** a new tool for scarless stitches?

What if I say the conference if for *Surgeons*?

What if I say the conference deals with *Health Administration*?

I guess knowing for which kind of doctor the conference if for, will make your answers much clearer than, right?

Knowing your Target Audience is basic knowledge for any service or product – without it you just might waste your time.

> Simply put – a Target Audience is who you focus your marketing and product efforts on.

### The benefits of using a Target Audience

Target Audience can help you product endeavours and your marketing campaigns by being more focused – and everything that help you and the org be more focused in your work is blessing. 

- ***Effective Marketing***
    
    Develop more effective marketing messages and campaigns by tailoring communication to resonate with you audience specific needs, interests, and pain points.
    
    Allocate resources efficiently by spending marketing budget on channels and activities that are most likely to reach their target audience.
    
- ***Helps Define the Product or Service***
    
    By knowing your audience you can create products and services that truly meet their needs. Increase you understanding of what features and benefits are most important to your target customers and focus on delivering them.
    
- ***Important step in a brand guide***
    
    Unfortunately quite a lot of managers don’t really want to know what they are aiming for, liking the fog of war – not willing to commit to their company values, tone and voice and other initiatives that define strong & reliable brands. 
    
    Setting the Target Audience is great starting point to make things clearer and demystify conceptions. Moreover it causes the least resistance for thickheaded managers in setting a brand guide and is an awesome gateway for this brand initiative.  
    
- ***Build a stronger brand***
    
    Once you know the audience you’re reaching, it will be easier to communicate and interact in a more personalized and meaningful manner thus creating a better experience. 
    
    This knowledge will provide the basis for building [Personas](https://www.notion.so/Personas-987287bb414d4d938ecf98488384b176?pvs=21), which in turn with the company [Vision & Mission](https://www.notion.so/Vision-Mission-8e974928e43e48e1af8df8905fb4f27e?pvs=21), 
    

## What is Target Audience?

A **target audience** is a focused group of people – an ideal go-to customers – that a brand identifies as **most likely to be interested in their products or services** and aims to reach directly with their advertising efforts.

**Target audience** shares similar attributes – such as interests, context or needs – an it addresses goals, jobs to be done, or unmeet needs.

This group shares certain characteristics, such as:

- **Demographics:** Age, gender, income, location, education, family status, etc.
- **Psychographics:** Values, interests, hobbies, lifestyle, personality traits, etc.
- **Behavioral factors:** Purchasing habits, media consumption, online activity, etc.

> A Target Audience is a group of people who share similar attributes or needs and can relate to, consume, or take part in an idea, service or product.
> 

### Groups in Target Audience

It’s important to recognize that there is more than one target audience. Usually, ideas or products don’t address only one group of people.

The audience is comprised of many people sharing similar attributes or needs, which can be wide or narrow. Let’s take for example heavy metal music – are all its listeners the same? No, we have sub-genres like: Thrash, Death, Black, Power, Doom, Gothic, Symphonic, Progressive, Folk, Nu, Industrial, Metalcore, Deathcore, Sludge, Stoner, Groove, Avant-garde and Alternative Metal – each attracting different audiences – some don’t overlap at all, some really despise other sub-genres.

In the heavy metal music, we can take our group segmentation even further; why just Listeners? What about Musicians or Apparel. That is, if you promote music, or sell music gear, or sell fashion – your audience might be different, with different needs and different sub-groups.

We usually divide our audience into two or three groups.

Dividing into **more than three** groups can lead to **distraction** and **dispersal**:

- **Distraction**: Addressing too wide an audience can spread your efforts too thin and lead to inefficiency.
- **Dispersal**: Spreading your marketing message too wide makes it loose and unfocused, leading to a lack of trust from prospects.

Dividing into **less than two** groups can limit diversity and adaptability:

- **Diversity**: Overspecialization can breed weakness. It’s best to see your product or service from multiple perspectives.
- **Adaptability**: Your product or service will likely be used in unexpected ways. Embracing this reality makes you more resilient.

The **overlap** between these audiences forms your **Target Audience**.

### Example: Addressing different audiences, Figma & Sketch

Let’s take a product like Figma - they say the product is used by three different teams, or roles: Design, Engineering teams and Product. We can clearly see them as different target audience, and thought it’s plain to see that design is the primary grope they haven’t skipped the other groups.

![Roles in Figma](/posts/target-audience/figma-roles.webp)
*Roles in Figma*

And again, the aim is to: 

- Prioritize the marketing and product efforts. Thus giving the appropriate groups the right amounts of focus to gain the most effective results.
- Inform users about your product or service in the right manner.
- Make your product or service more relevant and engaging.

And we can go even deeper still - we can break each audience into its own groups. 

For example; Sketch, that like Figma (but a superior product) supports additional groups other then designers and is showing specific use case in the Primary designers audience: as we can se in their website, Websites, Prototyping, Icons, Feedback, Apps, Symbols, Illustrations & Design Systems.

### Example: Targeting different audiences, Monday.com

A great example of a product addressing multiple target audiences is [Monday.com](http://monday.com/) campaign from 2018. This project management tool tailors its marketing to different user types, demonstrating how one product can cater to various needs and preferences.

By tailoring their marketing messages, [Monday.com](http://monday.com/) can effectively engage and convert different audience segments.

## How to Define Target Audience

### Review Customer Base

Though this one is relevant only a working business, and its quite obvious, seeing who drives your sales or which group uses the product the most is the an easy way to see the current situation. I could be just as you expected or you could be surprised but it a low hanging fruit.

### Talk with stakeholders <br > and people of interest

If you’re in working business, go and talk with stakeholders, if you’re not, go and talk with people of interest form this field - especially form sales people – they can give you an insight for who drives your sales or which group uses the product the most. This is the easies most secure way to see the current situation. I could be just as you expected or you could be surprised but it a low hanging fruit.

### Heuristics and Research

Use your common sense man! The data is there, you should go find it in every way possible, play with it, manipulate it, try to think about it from for surprising ways (be the devils advocate, use the [Five Ws](https://www.notion.so/Five-Ws-one-H-0a3e242375d046c3a85390cb624a07cc?pvs=21) way, do some [Product Research](https://www.notion.so/Product-Research-8ec9591bcfa44fa7b34c083a27c28fae?pvs=21), [Card sorting](https://www.notion.so/Card-sorting-Sticky-notes-78dcbd8d04664f4fbeb4dfbc71d2c1da?pvs=21) or [User Research](https://www.notion.so/User-Research-Testing-cc993192e98b42fa831a8f50f331d548?pvs=21). [Competitive Analysis](https://www.notion.so/Competitive-Audit-Analysis-30e19dea2cc4450d8e7abd9373be7645?pvs=21) is always important, or review your [Analytics](https://www.notion.so/Analytics-05e015e0f18a406f8ba0cf344b7564c0?pvs=21) if you have any.

## Things to Keep in Mind

### Different Audiences <br > in the same organization

Even within the same company, different groups might have different Target Audience depending different to their objectives. It could be counter intuitive for the Target Audience can differ by need or group in the organization. 

Here’s an example from I experienced personally: 

Right now (2024) I’m leading the product design at [Pepperi](https://www.pepperi.com/), and in the last year I’m also helping the management to fine tune and explore Pepperi brand. That lead to a surprising realization - the Target Audience for the **Product** team is different form the Target Audience  of the **Marketing** and **Sales** teams.

The **Marketing** and **Sales** Target Audience are decision makers or managers that realize – they will probably never gonna use the product itself. While the **Product**’s Target Audience are people that actually using Pepperi platform day in day out. For the most part they have no overlap, not in terms of massaging nor features.

### It's not just about demographics

While demographics are important, they only paint part of the picture. Psychographics and behavioral factors can be just as important in defining your target audience.

### Target Audience evolves over time

As your brand grows and changes, your target audience may need to be re-evaluated and refined.

### The Reverse Funnel

When a product or service starts its usually addressing a narrow Target Audience. As it grows the Target Audience, usually becomes wider.

We can actually see it in their brand – how they start unique and in time consolidate into something more homogeneous to address a wider Target Audience. This is just a visual aspect, but it happens company wide.
