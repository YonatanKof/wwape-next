Hi all ðŸ‘‹  

Just a boring page to review all the *Markdown* styles for this *Nuxt* website.

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that uses plain text formatting syntax, making it easy to write and read formatted documents.

## Titles 

How to write titles.

> `id`s are auto generated, so ***Boring Title***, will be `id="boring-title"`. 
> 
> In regular MD, If you'd like a custom id the do this â†’ `# Boring Title {#boring}`.
> 
> But in *Nuxt Content* you'll need to warp in brackets â†’ `# [Boring Title]{#boring}`.
