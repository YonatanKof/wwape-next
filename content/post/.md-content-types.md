Hi all 👋  
Let's see what we have here

# Boring H1 Title
## Boring H2 Title
### Boring H3 Title
#### Boring H4 Title
##### Boring H5 Title
###### Boring H6 Title

::LShape
::

This post ain't interesting at all 🤷 It's just to showcase all of the *Markdown* styles for this *Nuxt* website.

> BTW, I'm using [vue-remark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gridsome/vue-remark) to transform MD

## Humdrum H2 Title

I'm using my own **design system**, it's a great way to manage design and theming, and doing it with SCSS is easy and fun – relative to a tool like Sketch – which is awesome but tedious. 

Please keep an eye over [Kof Design System](https://share.goabstract.com/03c7ec17-6183-4b14-9528-59e90014e79e)

### Dull H3 Title

Because of vue-remark I can add Vue components into my markdown. Like this 3D viewer/controller from an article about Perspective I'm writing:


#### Monotonous H4 Title

##### Stale H5 Title

###### Tiresome H6 Title

This text is **Strong Text**

This text is *Emphasized Text*

This text is ~~Strikethrough *Text* Text **Text**~~

## Blockquotes 

### Regular stuff

> This is *Blockquote*. Write `>` to use
> 
> With multi paragraph
> 
>> With nested blockquote
>> 
>>> Another nested blockquote
>
> #### Welcome to the desert of the real 🏖
>
> - Quickly in and quickly out is all the advice I can give you.
> - I believe that stopping the siege on Harrogath is the only way for you to earn the trust of these people.  

>  Very nice – *Everything* is going according to **plan**.

## And with three types of *hints* 

!> **Tip** Blockquote, generates class `hint` & `tip`. Write `!>` to use

?> **Attention** Blockquote, generates class `hint` & `waring`. Write `?>` to use

x> **Error** Blockquote, generates class `hint` & `error`. Write `x>` to use

This is a paragraph -> The time has come for you to destroy Mephisto's Soulstone! Take the Stone to the Hellforge. Place it upon the forge and strike it soundly with the Hammer. Only by doing this can you prevent Mephisto from manifesting in this world ever again. 1/6 3/4 3/4

## Preformatted tag

```
This is a Preformatted tag (pre). Warp with ``` to use
```

    Or just use a tab indent

<!-- You acn use a comment markup to separate elements -->
    <html>
        <body>
            <h1>You acn use a comment markup to separate elements</h1>
        </body>
    </html>  


## Code Snippets

    }
};
```
#### In order to have the image caption right there should be 2 things:

- No space between the image and the caption 
- The caption should have an `*`, i.e be an `em` tag
