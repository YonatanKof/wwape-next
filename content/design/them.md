This illustration is based on an [Aboriginal rock engraving](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:N%27Dhala_Gorge005a.webp#/media/File:N'Dhala_Gorge005a.webp) form the [N'Dhala Gorge Nature Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%27Dhala_Gorge_Nature_Park), which in turn is based on a [drawing by Franz Gnaedinger](http://www.seshat.ch/home/ndhala.GIF) â€“ showing two figures wearing a **rayed headdresses**. 

<!-- [early calendar](http://www.seshat.ch/home/calendar.htm) -->

This is an early calendar where every ray of the headdresses represent a fortnight (14 nights, not the game). The woman (the pink figure) has 14 rays, the man (the green figure) has 12 rays, totaling in 26 rays times 14, represent 364 days, while the circle of the woman's head represent the new year's day resulting a solar year of 365 days.
