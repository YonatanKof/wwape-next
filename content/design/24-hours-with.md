The snake's expressive face, with its menacing teeth, suggests a level of intelligence and cunning that goes beyond its reptilian existence. Attributing human emotions and characteristics to a snake risks imposing our own subjective interpretations onto the animal. The snake, in its silent mystique, its true essence concealed beneath the veil of our anthropomorphic projections â€“ reflects of our human tendency to love and hate the *other*, and to seek understanding in the unfamiliar.
