{{ $doc.description }}

Like a digestive system society, is a product of its environment, its conditions, of us and our fire technology. Randomness and uncertainty inherent in the process of evolution, means the outcome could have been different under different circumstances – but not with us – techno-animal. Cooking made our digestion external, taking of its energy load passing it to our brains - making society. Its us and chaos.
