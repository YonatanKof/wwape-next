This food is the gift of the whole universe, each morsel is a sacrifice of life, may I be worthy to receive it. May the energy in this food, give me the strength, to transform my unwholesome qualities into wholesome ones. I'm grateful for this food, may I realize the path of awakening, for the sake of all beings â€“ **Namo Amida Buddha**
