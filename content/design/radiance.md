A stream of energy-carrying particles, emanating from one source, spreading to another. We radiate periodic disturbances, waves propagating in space. We radiate at dangerous levels - for our bodies, for others â€“ to fuck the other. Cancerous energy beam burns, destroys cellular structures, produces genetic changes, gives life, and kills. It's a beautiful solar burst to watch out from, the splitting of the atom, its fusion, the mother of life, the father of lies.
