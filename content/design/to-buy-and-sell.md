It's all about the trade  

For the wise eyes is apparent that the man is both divine and demonic

### Six Hundred Threescore & Six

This design is an Hebrew take of *Aphrodite's Child*'s 1972 album cover, aptly named **666**, and was loosely inspired by Doron Fishler's podcast *The Answer*, episode 74 -> [What's wrong with 666](https://www.osimhistoria.com/theanswer/ep74-666). If you don't know the album, you should! [So please have a listen using this link](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9EAiJXXtc-bdbxNvRZCRs402jnbC_bxw&si=gADgSht99uJQFS69)
