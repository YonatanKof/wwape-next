My lose translation:

> ## Coastline Paradox | Hila Ruach

> Coastline paradox  
From Bat Yam   
To infinity  
Garbage can kingdom  
No vacancy in internal ward 6  
Only lonely old women wail  
It's so scary to hang on  
Yet we all try hard  
...  
Hold my bones my Love  
Turn me into something good  
Hold my bones tight  
My love  
...  
Coastline paradox  
From Bat Yam to infinity  
The rulers are broke  
The treatment is over  
Side effects regressed  
Destroy the world  
Yet I am  
Looking here  
Looking there
