Hi Guy,  
A few words of what I'll bring as a DS lead at Melio:

- Working knowledge of complex design systems
- A proven ability to lead teams without authority 
- A designer who code, this site for example but much more
- Working lean and effective 
- Absolute control over tools
- Recommendations form managers and other leading figures 
- Shifting the DS form a hard *challenge* to a *non-problem* to a *success*


## Design System

At Pepperi I’ve wear several hats, one of them was to create Pepperi Design System (hereinafter ***PDS***), for both the *Product* and *Brand* teams. 

Let's review the products Design System

### PSD, Product Basic Storybook 

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
This is the basic Storybook being used by the Product and development teams. It contains, in terms of *Brad Frost*'s *Atomic Design*, the *Atoms* [(typography, color, spacing etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"} and *Molecules* [(buttons, inputs, link image etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"}.

  > In this Storybook I've written the MDX dcos myself.

### PDS, Product Composite Storybook 

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
  This is the composite Storybook being used by the Product and development teams. It contains the *Organisms* [(selectors, pickers, etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"}, *Templates* [(lists, forms, layouts, editors, etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"} and *Pages* which are now a work in progress.

  > Duo to code ar architecture we had to separate the two projects – In a perfect world they would have been presented in the same project.

Now let's review the Brand Design System

### PDS, Brand Guide

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
  In this guide I've worked with management to set brand value, mission statement, tone and voice. Worked wit marketing team to agree upon the visual aspect and the imagery. And lastly with IT the create the brand sub-domain.
