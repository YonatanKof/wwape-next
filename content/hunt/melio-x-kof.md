Hi Guy,  
A few words of what I'll bring as a DS lead at Melio:

- Working knowledge of complex design systems
- A proven ability to lead teams without authority 
- A designer who code, this site for example but but ask to see more
- Writing guides and PRDs 
- Best practices in Collaboration and Sharing 
- Best practices in Backlog management 
- Working lean and effective 
- Total control over tools
- Recommendations form managers and other leading figures 
- Shifting the DS form a hard *challenge* to a *success*


## Design System

At Pepperi I’ve wear several hats, one of them was to create Pepperi Design System (hereinafter ***PDS***), for both the *Product* and *Brand* teams. 

Let's review the products Design System

### PSD, Product Basic Storybook 

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
This is the basic Storybook being used by the Product and development teams. It contains, in terms of *Brad Frost*'s *Atomic Design*, the *Atoms* [(typography, color, spacing etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"} and *Molecules* [(buttons, inputs, link image etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"}.

### PDS, Product Composite Storybook 

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
  This is the composite Storybook being used by the Product and development teams. It contains the *Organisms* [(selectors, pickers, etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"}, *Templates* [(lists, forms, layouts, editors, etc'.)]{style="color: var(--color-sys-slight)"} and *Pages* which are now a work in progress.

Now let's review the Brand Design System

### PDS, Brand Guide

::gridBlock{colNum="2" gap="var(--space-m);"}
:::grid-unit
  
  In this guide I've worked with management to set brand value, mission statement, tone and voice. Worked wit marketing team to agree upon the visual aspect and the imagery. And lastly with IT the create the brand sub-domain.
