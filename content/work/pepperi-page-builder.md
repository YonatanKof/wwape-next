With *Pepperi Page Builder*, clients of our B2B plan can build, edit and design of their webpages. Now they can prompt, present and sale with total **workflow** control, utilizing **buyer profiles**, at their own time, with a no-code interface.

## The motivation for the project

Pepperi clients want to show Buyers (our clients’ clients) custom homepages. Where they can communicate promotions, sales, credit lines, new products, product categories, and all things related to B2B eCommerce.

Moreover, they want to do it on brand, with full design control. They want to edit the content themselves and do it on their own time. We believe that a custom page builder, which enables our clients to easily create these features, is the way to go.

Understanding that our clients wanted this feature was easy because they not only asked for it, but also built it. Some of our clients actually worked with the FS team, who built and maintained a custom webpage for a while. And in my first few years at Pepperi, I worked with the PS team to design and build these custom homepages.

## The problem

Custom web pages were built with custom code by developers form our Professional Services dev team, this leads to some problems 

- The pages aren’t consistent in design and not aligned with Pepperi DS
- Not playing along with other Pepperi products and features like:
    - Pepperi theme editor
    - Pepperi header builder
    - Native app integration
    - Version updates
- Can’t be built or maintained by the clients
- Can be used only by FS team causing dependency and scalability issues
