With *Pepperi Page Builder*, clients of our B2B plan can build, edit and design of their webpages. Now they can prompt, present and sale with total **workflow** control, utilizing **buyer profiles**, at their own time, with a no-code interface.


## The motivation for the project

Pepperi clients want to show Buyers (our clients’ clients) custom homepages. Where they can communicate promotions, sales, credit lines, new products, product categories, and all things related to B2B eCommerce.

Moreover, they want to do it on brand, with full design control. They want to edit the content themselves and do it on their own time. We believe that a custom page builder, which enables our clients to easily create these features, is the way to go.

Understanding that our clients wanted this feature was easy because they not only asked for it, but also built it. Some of our clients actually worked with the FS team, who built and maintained a custom webpage for a while. And in my first few years at Pepperi, I worked with the PS team to design and build these custom homepages.

## The problem

Though custom web pages can offer our clients maximum flexibility in terms of design and functionality they had multiple issues in terms of business and product. As mentioned, custom web pages were built with native web code by our Professional Services devs – this lead to the following Issues: 

- The pages aren’t consistent in design and not aligned with Pepperi DS
- Not playing along with other Pepperi products and features like:
    - Pepperi theme editor
    - Pepperi header builder
    - Native app integration
    - Version updates
- Can’t be build or maintained by the clients
- Can be used only by FS team causing dependency and scalability issues

## Research

### Understating the current state

As mentioned, we had a few clients with custom homepages. Reviewing their pages, we can easily see patterns arise. This is nice for two reasons: firstly, these pages underwent a proper process where a PRD and a UX flow were carried out following inquiries with the client. Secondly, these pages were a few years/months old with sufficient time to grow and show their true usage and intent.

So, we came to this initiative with a lot of information from the start.

### Card sorting

In order to manage the information, we conducted a few card sorting sessions with several stakeholders from different teams (development, product, PS, pre-sales, partners, and a few clients) to conveniently form the data into an organized and manageable structure.

### Comparative research

## Measuring success

### Indicators

- Dogfooding
- Adoption

### Quantitive

- **Sales**
    - We’ve effectively opened a new sales category and we have seen a steady increase in demand.
- **Time**
    - The PS has stopped using their development efforts in building and maintaining  custom built webpages.
    - There was a shift in focus from managing content/workflows form the PS to the clients.
- **Usage**
    - Client are using it; both business (producers) and buyer (consumers).
    - Content management by clients
    - Template design – with every use case we created a templet to be reused

### Qualitative

- Interviews with admin users; PSs, Admins and ITs using and managing the pages built with code.
- Interviews with functional users; Sales managers, and Brand managers asking the admins for requirements form the webpages and are also the role that manage the content of the page (promotions, sales, categories, workflows, copy & images).
- Interviews with end users - Buyers and Reps.

## Next

One of our clients top priorities is to communicate their brand and business needs to their clients via a custom homepage. Pepperi’s legacy approach of creating a custom homepage from scratch can make content management challenging if not problematic, for it’s dependent on the *Professional Team* developers. 

The *Page Builder* addresses this issue by enabling our clients to modify, add, and design content on the flay. Furthermore, we can now tailor pages based on roles and business requirements.

The *Page Builder* provides users with control over the page layout, and content is edited using *content blocks*. These blocks include Slideshows, Galleries, Charts, Forms, Rich Text, Banners, Buttons, Filters, Search, with future additions like Chat, Categories, Stack layout, and HTML block.
